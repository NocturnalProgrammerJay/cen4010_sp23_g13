# Online Library Application

The Online Library Application is a web-based application that allows users to browse, search and borrow books online. The application provides a user-friendly interface, with features such as a book catalog, a shopping cart and a list of borrowed books.

## Demo

You can try out our online library application by visiting the following link: http://localhost:3000/

To log in, use the following demo credentials:

Username: username@fau.edu
Password: password123

Note that this is just a demo and no actual borrowing or purchasing of books is possible.

## Features

- **Browse books online:** Users can search for books by title, author or keyword, and view book details such as cover image, author, publication date, ISBN and a brief summary.
- **Add to cart:** Users can add books to their shopping cart, which will keep track of their selected books until checkout.
- **Borrow books:** Users can see a list of books they have borrowed from the library, including the date borrowed, the due date and the option to return the book.
- **Node.js:** The application uses Node.js as the server-side framework to build the RESTful API.
- **EJS:** The application uses Embedded JavaScript (EJS) as the templating language to render dynamic content on the server-side.
- **MongoDB:** The application uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve book data.
- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:** The application uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the user interface design, which provides a responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript:** The application uses JavaScript to handle the client-side logic such as AJAX requests and form validations.
- **Frontend API call to backend:** The application communicates with the server-side API to retrieve book data and perform CRUD operations.
- **Google Book API:** The application integrates with the Google Book API to retrieve book information such as cover image and summary.
- **LocalStorage:** The application uses LocalStorage to store user session data and cart items.
