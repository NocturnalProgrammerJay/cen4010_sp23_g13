## Features

- **Browse books online:** Users can search for books by title, author or keyword, and view book details such as cover image, author, publication date, ISBN and a brief summary.
- **Add to cart:** Users can add books to their shopping cart, which will keep track of their selected books until checkout.
- **Borrow books:** Users can see a list of books they have borrowed from the library, including the date borrowed, the due date and the option to return the book.
- **Node.js:** The application uses Node.js as the server-side framework to build the RESTful API.
- **EJS:** The application uses Embedded JavaScript (EJS) as the templating language to render dynamic content on the server-side.
- **MongoDB:** The application uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve book data.
- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:** The application uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the user interface design, which provides a responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- **JavaScript and OOP:** The application uses JavaScript for the client-side logic, including OOP principles such as classes and objects.
- **Frontend API call to backend:** The application communicates with the server-side API to retrieve book data and perform CRUD operations.
- **Google Book API and Axios:** The application integrates with the Google Book API to retrieve book information such as cover image and summary, using Axios for the frontend API request.
Environment Variables: The application uses environment variables to store sensitive information such as the MongoDB connection string and Google API key.
